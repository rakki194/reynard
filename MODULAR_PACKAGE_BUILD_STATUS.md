24. **service-manager** - TypeScript errors in integrations
25. **settings** - Button component type issues
26. **ui** - Missing getSortIcon export
27. **unified-repository** - Multiple dependency issues

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. API Client Dependency Chain

Many packages fail due to broken `api-client` package:

- auth, caption, caption-multimodal, caption-ui, chat, comfy
- These packages depend on generated code that has issues

### 2. Repository Package Complexities

The repository packages have significant architectural issues:

- Missing `reynard-ai-shared` dependency
- String literals instead of enum values
- Missing properties and incorrect type usage
- Complex dependency chains

### 3. Component Export Issues

Several packages have missing exports:

- audio: AudioWaveformComponents
- rag: SearchSettings
- ui: getSortIcon

### 4. TypeScript Configuration Issues

- Type import/export conflicts
- Missing type declarations
- Incorrect import statements

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix API Client**: Resolve generated code issues in api-client package
2. **Fix Component Exports**: Add missing exports to audio, rag, ui packages
3. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: Resolve type conflicts and missing declarations

### Medium Priority

1. **Repository Packages**: These require significant architectural work
2. **Dependency Chain**: Fix cascading dependency failures
3. **Generated Code**: Review and fix code generation issues

### Low Priority

1. **Test Configurations**: Add vitest.config.ts to all packages
2. **Package.json**: Standardize configurations across packages

## Success Rate

- **Successfully Building**: 25/40 packages (62.5%)
- **Failing to Build**: 15/40 packages (37.5%)

## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing the API client package to resolve the dependency chain
2. Add missing exports to component packages
3. Address TypeScript configuration issues
4. Consider architectural refactoring for repository packages

## Notes

- The components packages (components-core, components-dashboard, components-charts, components-themes) are now building successfully after the recent fixes
- The fluent-icons package is building successfully after adding the Icon component
- The charts package is building successfully after adding the RealTimeDataPoint export
- Many failures are due to cascading dependencies rather than individual package issues
