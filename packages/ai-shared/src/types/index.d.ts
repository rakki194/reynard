/**
 * Shared AI/ML Types for Reynard
 *
 * This module provides common type definitions used across all AI/ML packages
 * in the Reynard framework. These types ensure consistency and type safety
 * throughout the AI/ML ecosystem.
 *
 * This file serves as a barrel export, re-exporting all types from focused modules
 * to maintain a clean public API while adhering to the 100-line axiom.
