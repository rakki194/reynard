- **Stabilization**: Diversity stabilized around 0.22-0.23
- **Mutation Effect**: Mutations introduced variability but overall convergence occurred

### 3. Trait Selection Pressure

- **Strategic Traits Favored**: Intelligence and cunning increased
- **Social Traits Declined**: Loyalty and patience decreased
- **Balanced Evolution**: No extreme trait values emerged

### 4. Spirit Competition

- **Lion Dominance**: Lions became the most populous spirit
- **Eagle Activity**: Eagles were most active in breeding
- **Balanced Distribution**: All spirits maintained significant populations

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Conclusions

### How the ECS World Evolves

1. **Genetic Convergence**: The ECS world shows a tendency toward genetic convergence over time, with decreasing diversity as successful traits become dominant.

2. **Strategic Evolution**: There's clear evolutionary pressure toward strategic thinking (intelligence and cunning), suggesting the environment favors problem-solving abilities.

3. **Social Dynamics**: The decline in loyalty and patience indicates a shift toward more independent, self-reliant behavior patterns.

4. **Population Explosion**: The high breeding success rate (100%) and population growth (173%) suggest an environment with abundant resources and low mortality.

5. **Spirit Specialization**: Different spirits show different evolutionary strategies, with lions becoming dominant through population growth and eagles through breeding activity.

### Key Evolutionary Mechanisms

1. **Trait Inheritance**: Offspring inherit averaged traits from parents with mutation
2. **Compatibility Selection**: Breeding is based on genetic compatibility
3. **Mutation Introduction**: Random mutations maintain genetic diversity
4. **Population Pressure**: Large populations create competitive breeding environments

## ðŸ“Š Data Files Generated

1. **`evolution_simulation_data.json`** - Raw simulation data (2,590 agents, 400 breeding events)
2. **`evolution_analysis_report.json`** - Comprehensive analysis with conclusions
