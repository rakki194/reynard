/**
 * ðŸ¦Š Reynard Animation Package
 * Unified animation system for Reynard
 *
 * This package consolidates all animation functionality from across the codebase:
 * - Core animation engines from test-app
 * - 3D animations from packages/3d
 * - Staggered animations from packages/ui/floating-panel
 * - Easing functions from packages/colors and packages/3d
 * - Performance monitoring and optimization
