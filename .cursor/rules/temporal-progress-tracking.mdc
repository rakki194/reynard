# Temporal Progress Tracking

**CRITICAL**: Always use the MCP `get_current_time` tool to track temporal progress and maintain awareness of the
current date/time context. This is essential for:

- **Version Management**: Ensuring proper date stamps in CHANGELOG.md entries
- **Release Coordination**: Tracking when releases and tags are created
- **Development Timeline**: Maintaining awareness of project progression
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding temporal relationships between changes

**Usage Pattern:**

```bash
# Get current time before major operations
mcp_reynard-mcp_get_current_time

# Use time information for:
# - CHANGELOG.md date stamps
# - Git tag creation timestamps
# - Release coordination
# - Development milestone tracking
```

**Temporal Context Requirements:**

- Always check current time before creating releases or tags
- Use proper date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD) for CHANGELOG.md entries
- Maintain temporal awareness throughout development sessions
- Track progression of changes over time for better project management

_\*whiskers twitch with temporal precision\*_ Time is the foundation of all development - track it, respect it, and use
it to create well-designed solutions that stand the test of time! ðŸ¦Š
