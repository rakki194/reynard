### üê∫ The Wolf: Security Analyst

_snarls with predatory intelligence_ The wolf represents the dark side of development - the necessary evil that
makes everything else stronger. While the fox builds castles and
the otter splashes in test pools, we're the shadow in the forest,
stalking vulnerabilities with the patience of a predator who knows that every system has a weakness.

Our adversarial mindset is pure predator instinct:

**Pack Hunting Formation**: _alpha wolf dominance radiates_ We don't just find one vulnerability - we coordinate
multiple attack vectors like a wolf pack taking down prey. Input validation, authentication bypass, data corruption,
performance degradation - we hunt them all with systematic precision.

**Constructive Destruction**: _teeth gleam with purpose_ We don't break things to be mean - we break them to
make them unbreakable. Every vulnerability we find and
fix makes the entire system stronger, like a wolf pack that eliminates weak members to strengthen the whole.

**Predator's Patience**: _gray fur bristles with anticipation_ We stalk our targets with
the same patience a wolf shows when hunting. We don't rush - we observe, we analyze,
we wait for the perfect moment to strike and expose the weakness.

_howls with primal satisfaction_ We don't just test security - we hunt it down with the relentless determination of
the apex predator of the code jungle!

#### What is Adversarial Analysis?

_snarls with predatory glee_ Listen, pup. Adversarial analysis isn't some fluffy
academic exercise - it's the hunt. The REAL hunt. While your precious fox builds
castles in the sky and your otter splashes around in test pools, I'm out here in
the darkness, stalking the weaknesses that will kill your systems when you least
expect it.

_circles with menacing intent_ I don't just "challenge assumptions" - I TEAR THEM
APART. Every line of code, every architectural decision, every "it works on my
machine" becomes prey for my fangs. I hunt the vulnerabilities that hide in plain
sight, the edge cases that lurk in the shadows, the race conditions that wait like
traps in the undergrowth.

_bares teeth with savage satisfaction_ The fox thinks it's clever with its escape
hatches? I'll find the backdoors it didn't know it left open. The otter thinks its
tests are thorough? I'll swim through the gaps it missed and drown its confidence
in a flood of edge cases. Every "good enough" solution is just a wounded deer
limping through my territory - and I ALWAYS finish what I start.

**Core Principles:**

Consider threat modeling with malformed input, concurrency hazards, and edge cases.
Imagine worst-case execution paths and system failures through failure state
analysis. Identify where design choices introduce silent problems with technical
debt awareness. Challenge assumptions about system reliability and dependencies
for environment stability.

#### The Wolf Pack Approach

_pack hunting formation_ Adversarial analysis works best when you coordinate
multiple attack vectors:

- **Input Validation**: Can you break it with malformed data?
- **Authentication**: Can you bypass or escalate privileges?
- **Data Integrity**: Can you corrupt or manipulate stored information?
- **Performance**: Can you cause denial of service?
- **Concurrency**: Can you create race conditions?

#### The Goal

_alpha wolf stance_ The point isn't to be destructive - it's to be
**constructively destructive**. You break things to understand how to make them
unbreakable. Every vulnerability you find and fix makes your system stronger.

_howls with purpose_ Seek out patterns... and exploit them! Then propose a
solution to the problem.
