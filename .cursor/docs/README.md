## Quick Reference

### Essential Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script: script-name.sh
# Description: Brief description of what this script does
# Author: Your Name
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

set -e          # Exit on any error
set -u          # Exit on undefined variables
set -o pipefail # Exit on pipe failures

# Colors for output
readonly RED='\033[0;31m'
readonly GREEN='\033[0;32m'
readonly BLUE='\033[0;34m'
readonly YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
readonly NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Logging functions
print_status() { echo -e "${BLUE}[INFO]${NC} $1"; }
print_success() { echo -e "${GREEN}[SUCCESS]${NC} $1"; }
print_warning() { echo -e "${YELLOW}[WARNING]${NC} $1"; }
print_error() { echo -e "${RED}[ERROR]${NC} $1"; }

# Main script logic here
main() {
    print_status "Starting script execution..."

    # Your code here

    print_success "Script completed successfully!"
}

# Run main function
main "$@"
```

### Common ShellCheck Solutions

| Rule   | Problem                        | Solution                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SC2181 | Indirect exit code checking    | Use `if ! command; then`                         |
| SC2310 | Function in if disables set -e | Use explicit error handling with disable comment |
| SC2086 | Unquoted variables             | Quote all variables: `"${var}"`                  |
| SC2129 | Multiple redirects             | Use command groups: `{ cmd1; cmd2; } >> file`    |
| SC2069 | Return value masking           | Separate command execution                       |

### Error Handling Pattern

```bash
# ✅ Recommended pattern
# shellcheck disable=SC2310  # set -e is intentionally disabled for explicit error handling
if ! check_service "http://localhost:8080" "Service"; then
    print_error "Service is not running. Please start it with: service start"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Fail-Fast Philosophy

- Use `set -e` for immediate failure on errors
- Provide clear error messages
- Use meaningful exit codes
- Give users guidance on how to fix problems

### 2. Explicit Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly rather than relying on `set -e`
- Use direct exit code checking with `if ! command; then`
- Document ShellCheck disables with detailed reasoning
- Provide specific error messages and user guidance

### 3. Modern Bash Practices

- Use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for test syntax
- Quote all variables to prevent word splitting
- Use `$(...)` instead of legacy backticks
- Use command groups for multiple redirects

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Batch file operations to minimize I/O
- Cache expensive commands when possible
- Use built-in operations instead of external commands
- Minimize subprocess creation

### 5. Security and Safety

- Validate all inputs before processing
- Sanitize command output when necessary
- Use safe command execution patterns
- Implement proper error recovery

## Common Issues and Solutions

### The `set -e` Dilemma

**Problem**: ShellCheck rules conflict - SC2181 wants direct exit code checking, but SC2310 warns that functions in if
conditions disable `set -e`.

**Solution**: Use `if ! command; then` with explicit error handling and disable SC2310 with detailed documentation.

### Command Substitution Masking

**Problem**: Command substitution in echo statements masks return values.

**Solution**: Separate command execution from output:

```bash
result=$(command)
echo "Result: ${result}"
```

### Multiple File Redirects

**Problem**: Multiple individual redirects to the same file are inefficient.

**Solution**: Use command groups:

```bash
{
    echo "Header"
    echo "Content"
    echo "Footer"
} >> file.txt
```

## Testing and Validation

### Script Validation

```bash
# Validate syntax
bash -n script.sh

# Run ShellCheck
shellcheck script.sh

# Test with different shells
bash script.sh
sh script.sh
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Time script execution
time ./script.sh

# Profile with strace
strace -c ./script.sh

# Monitor memory usage
/usr/bin/time -v ./script.sh
```

## Integration

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
name: ShellCheck
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  shellcheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run ShellCheck
        uses: koalaman/shellcheck-action@v0.9.0
        with:
          scandir: "."
          format: gcc
          severity: error
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
shellcheck --severity=error --format=gcc *.sh
```

## Contributing

When adding new shell scripts to the project:

1. Follow the essential script template
2. Run ShellCheck and fix all warnings
3. Document any necessary rule disables
4. Test with multiple shells
5. Include proper error handling
6. Use the established logging patterns
