# Crisis Management Framework

## Comprehensive Crisis Management for Repository Integrity and Release Operations

**Author**: Success-Advisor-8 (Permanent Release Manager)
**Date**: 2025-09-20
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## Overview

The Crisis Management Framework provides a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and resolving critical issues that threaten repository integrity, release quality, or system stability within the Reynard ecosystem. This framework ensures rapid response, minimal impact, and comprehensive recovery from crisis situations.

## Crisis Management Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Rapid Response**: Immediate identification and assessment of critical issues
2. **Systematic Resolution**: Structured approach to crisis resolution
3. **Minimal Impact**: Reduce disruption to ongoing development and releases
4. **Comprehensive Recovery**: Full restoration of system integrity
5. **Prevention Focus**: Learn from crises to prevent future occurrences

## Crisis Detection and Assessment

### Early Warning Systems

#### Repository Integrity Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Repository Integrity Crisis Detection

echo "🔍 Monitoring repository integrity..."

# Check for build artifacts in source directories
BUILD_ARTIFACTS=$(find ./packages -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.d.ts" | grep -v node_modules | wc -l)
if [ "$BUILD_ARTIFACTS" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "🚨 CRISIS: Build artifacts detected in source directories"
    echo "   Files affected: $BUILD_ARTIFACTS"
    echo "   Severity: HIGH"
    echo "   Action: Immediate cleanup required"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for large files in repository
LARGE_FILES=$(find . -size +10M -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.git/*" | wc -l)
if [ "$LARGE_FILES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Large files detected in repository"
    echo "   Files: $LARGE_FILES"
    echo "   Action: Review and optimize"
fi

# Check git repository health
if ! git fsck --full --strict > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "🚨 CRISIS: Git repository corruption detected"
    echo "   Severity: CRITICAL"
    echo "   Action: Immediate repository recovery required"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Repository integrity verified"
```

#### Release Quality Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Release Quality Crisis Detection

echo "🔍 Monitoring release quality..."

# Check for critical linting errors
CRITICAL_LINT=$(pnpm lint 2>&1 | grep -c "error" || echo "0")
if [ "$CRITICAL_LINT" -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "🚨 CRISIS: Critical linting errors detected"
    echo "   Errors: $CRITICAL_LINT"
    echo "   Severity: HIGH"
    echo "   Action: Immediate code quality fix required"
fi

# Check for security vulnerabilities
SECURITY_ISSUES=$(pnpm audit --audit-level=high 2>&1 | grep -c "vulnerabilities" || echo "0")
if [ "$SECURITY_ISSUES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "🚨 CRISIS: Security vulnerabilities detected"
    echo "   Issues: $SECURITY_ISSUES"
    echo "   Severity: CRITICAL"
    echo "   Action: Immediate security patch required"
fi

# Check test failure rate
TEST_FAILURES=$(pnpm test 2>&1 | grep -c "FAIL" || echo "0")
if [ "$TEST_FAILURES" -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "🚨 CRISIS: High test failure rate detected"
    echo "   Failures: $TEST_FAILURES"
    echo "   Severity: HIGH"
    echo "   Action: Immediate test fix required"
fi

echo "✅ Release quality verified"
```

### Crisis Severity Assessment

#### Severity Levels

1. **CRITICAL**: Immediate threat to system integrity or security
2. **HIGH**: Significant impact on release quality or user experience
3. **MEDIUM**: Moderate impact with workaround available
4. **LOW**: Minor impact with minimal user disruption

#### Assessment Matrix

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Crisis Severity Assessment

assess_crisis_severity() {
    local crisis_type="$1"
    local impact_scope="$2"
    local user_affected="$3"
    local data_integrity="$4"

    local severity="LOW"

    # Critical conditions
    if [[ "$crisis_type" == "security" && "$data_integrity" == "compromised" ]]; then
        severity="CRITICAL"
    elif [[ "$impact_scope" == "system_wide" && "$user_affected" == "all" ]]; then
        severity="CRITICAL"
    elif [[ "$crisis_type" == "repository" && "$data_integrity" == "corrupted" ]]; then
        severity="CRITICAL"

    # High conditions
    elif [[ "$impact_scope" == "major" && "$user_affected" == "many" ]]; then
        severity="HIGH"
    elif [[ "$crisis_type" == "release" && "$user_affected" == "many" ]]; then
        severity="HIGH"

    # Medium conditions
    elif [[ "$impact_scope" == "moderate" && "$user_affected" == "some" ]]; then
        severity="MEDIUM"
    fi

    echo "$severity"
}
```

## Crisis Response Procedures

### Immediate Response Protocol

#### Step 1: Crisis Declaration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Crisis Declaration Protocol

declare_crisis() {
    local crisis_id="$1"
    local crisis_type="$2"
    local severity="$3"
    local description="$4"

    echo "🚨 CRISIS DECLARED"
    echo "=================="
    echo "Crisis ID: $crisis_id"
    echo "Type: $crisis_type"
    echo "Severity: $severity"
    echo "Description: $description"
    echo "Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)"
    echo "Declared by: Success-Advisor-8 (Permanent Release Manager)"

    # Log crisis declaration
    cat >> crisis-log.json << EOF
{
  "crisis_id": "$crisis_id",
  "type": "$crisis_type",
  "severity": "$severity",
  "description": "$description",
  "declared_at": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "declared_by": "Success-Advisor-8",
  "status": "active"
}
EOF
}
```

#### Step 2: Impact Assessment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Crisis Impact Assessment

assess_crisis_impact() {
    local crisis_id="$1"

    echo "📊 Assessing crisis impact..."

    echo "🔍 System Impact:"
    echo "  - Repository size: $(du -sh . | cut -f1)"
    echo "  - Active branches: $(git branch -r | wc -l)"
    echo "  - Pending commits: $(git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD | wc -l)"
    echo "  - Open issues: $(gh issue list --state open | wc -l)"

    # User impact assessment
    echo "👥 User Impact:"
    echo "  - Active developers: $(git log --since="1 day ago" --pretty=format:"%an" | sort -u | wc -l)"
    echo "  - Recent deployments: $(git log --since="1 week ago" --grep="deploy" | wc -l)"

    # Business impact assessment
    echo "💼 Business Impact:"
    echo "  - Release timeline: $(git log --oneline --grep="release" | head -1)"
