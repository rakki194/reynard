# Microservices Overview & Introduction

> **Understanding the Foundation of Distributed Systems** 🦊

## What Are Microservices?

Microservices are a software architecture pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is organized around business capabilities and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Core Definition

A **microservice** is a small, autonomous service designed to handle a specific business function within a larger application. Each microservice operates independently, has its own technology stack, and communicates with other services through lightweight protocols, such as APIs.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

- Each microservice focuses on **one specific business capability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-defined boundaries
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Independent Deployment

- Services can be **deployed, updated, and scaled independently**
- No need to redeploy the entire application
- Faster development cycles
- Reduced deployment risk

### 3. Decentralized Data Management

- Each microservice **manages its own database**
- Optimized data storage for specific needs
- No shared database dependencies
- Data consistency through eventual consistency patterns

### 4. Communication via APIs

- Services interact through **well-defined APIs**
- Lightweight protocols (HTTP, gRPC, messaging)
- Language and technology agnostic
- Loose coupling between services

### 5. Autonomous Operation

- Services run **independently with their own lifecycle**
- Own configuration management
- Independent scaling decisions
- Fault isolation

### 6. Technology Stack Independence

- Each service can use **different technologies**
- Choose the best tool for each job
- Gradual technology adoption
- Team autonomy in technology choices

## Microservices vs. Monoliths

### Monolithic Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Monolithic App            │
│  ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐   │
│  │ UI  │ │ API │ │ DB  │ │ Auth│   │
│  └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘   │
│                                     │
│        Single Deployment Unit       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Characteristics:**

- Single deployment unit
- Shared database
- Tightly coupled components
- Single technology stack
- Centralized configuration
