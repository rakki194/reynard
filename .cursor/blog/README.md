## Content Philosophy

### Blog vs Documentation

**Blog Content** (this directory):

- **Narrative structure** with story elements
- **Research findings** and academic analysis
- **Experimental results** and testing experiences
- **Case studies** with lessons learned
- **Journey documentation** of processes
- **Opinion pieces** and analysis

**Documentation Content** (`.cursor/docs`):

- **Reference material** for ongoing use
- **Step-by-step guides** and procedures
- **Technical specifications** and standards
- **Operational procedures** and workflows
- **Best practices** and patterns
- **Troubleshooting guides**

## Contributing
