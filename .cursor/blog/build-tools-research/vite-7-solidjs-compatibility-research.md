# Vite 7 and SolidJS Compatibility Research

**Date:** January 15, 2025
**Investigation:** Peer dependency warnings with vite-plugin-solid and Vite 7.1.5
**Status:** Research Complete

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes research findings regarding compatibility between Vite 7.1.5 and SolidJS, specifically addressing peer dependency warnings encountered with `vite-plugin-solid` version 2.5.0.

## Key Findings

### ❌ No Native SolidJS Support in Vite 7

**Critical Discovery:** Vite 7 does **not** include built-in SolidJS support. The `vite-plugin-solid` plugin remains **essential** for any SolidJS integration with Vite, regardless of version.

### Current Plugin Status

- **Latest Version:** `vite-plugin-solid` 2.11.8
- **Current Project Version:** 2.5.0 (outdated)
- **Vite 7 Support:** Not yet available
- **Supported Vite Versions:** 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x

## Why vite-plugin-solid is Essential

The plugin provides critical functionality that Vite lacks natively:

### 1. JSX Transformation

- Converts SolidJS JSX syntax to JavaScript
- Handles SolidJS-specific JSX patterns
- Prevents "React is not defined" errors

### 2. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

- Real-time updates during development
- Preserves component state during updates
- Essential for modern development workflow

### 3. TypeScript Support

- Processes `.tsx` files correctly
- Maintains type safety throughout build process
- Integrates with Vite's TypeScript handling

### 4. Reactivity System Integration

- Properly processes SolidJS's fine-grained reactivity
- Ensures signals and effects work correctly
- Maintains performance optimizations

### 5. Bundle Optimization

- Code splitting for SolidJS components
- Tree shaking for unused SolidJS features
- Optimized production builds

## What Happens Without the Plugin

Attempting to use SolidJS with Vite without `vite-plugin-solid` results in:

- **Build Failures:** "React is not defined" errors
- **No HMR:** Development experience severely degraded
- **Broken Reactivity:** SolidJS's core feature doesn't work
- **TypeScript Errors:** Compilation failures with `.tsx` files
- **Runtime Errors:** Components fail to render correctly

- Discord community feedback on plugin requirements

### Package Registry Information

- npm package pages for version compatibility
- Socket.dev security and compatibility analysis
- Package dependency tree analysis

## Conclusion

The peer dependency warnings are **non-blocking** but indicate that `vite-plugin-solid` has not yet been updated to officially support Vite 7. The plugin remains essential for SolidJS development with Vite, and the warnings should be addressed through proper dependency management rather than attempting to work without the plugin.

## Next Steps

1. Update `vite-plugin-solid` to latest version (2.11.8)
2. Test build functionality despite peer dependency warnings
3. Monitor plugin repository for Vite 7 support updates
4. Consider Vite 6.x downgrade if stability is critical
