**Total Points**: 0/1500
**Level**: Novice Context Detective
**Achievements**: None yet

## üîç Research Findings & Architecture Analysis

### Current System Analysis

- **Existing Architecture**: Multi-analyzer system with PatternAnalyzer, SentimentAnalyzer, HexacoAnalyzer, EpistemicHumilityAnalyzer, LiwcAnalyzer
- **False Positive Issues**: Detecting "all", "only", "best" in technical contexts (API docs, code comments, validation rules)
- **Markdown Infrastructure**: Existing streaming markdown parser with code block detection in Chat package
- **Pattern Categories**: 12+ detection categories with regex-based matching
- **Integration Points**: HumilityDetector orchestrates multiple analyzers with cultural adaptation

### Key False Positive Patterns Identified

1. **Technical Documentation**: "all available languages", "alphanumeric and underscores only"
2. **API Documentation**: "required", "optional", "default" parameters
3. **Code Comments**: Technical terms in inline comments
4. **Configuration Files**: JSON/YAML parameter descriptions
5. **Error Messages**: Technical error descriptions
