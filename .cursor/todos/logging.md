## üö® **Critical Issues to Address First**

1. **Console Statement Chaos** - 200+ console statements across 6 packages
2. **No Centralized Logging** - Each package has its own logging approach
3. **Production Logging Issues** - Debug logs in production builds
4. **No Error Correlation** - Errors can't be traced across packages
5. **Missing Performance Context** - Logs don't include performance data
