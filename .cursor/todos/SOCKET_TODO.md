# 🔐 Auth Package Dependency Restructuring TODO

## Overview

Implement comprehensive dependency restructuring for the authentication system, creating a layered architecture that eliminates circular dependencies and establishes clear separation of concerns. This involves creating new packages (`reynard-http-client`, `reynard-auth-core`, `reynard-auth-composables`) and restructuring the existing `reynard-auth` package according to the proposed architecture diagram.

## ✅ Current Status

- [x] **Dependency Restructuring**: Resolved auth ↔ connection package integration issues
- [x] **Build Success**: Auth package builds successfully without HTTPClient dependency
- [x] **Ecosystem Harmony**: Prompt-note example builds successfully with auth integration
- [x] **Foundation Layer Complete**: Created `reynard-http-client`, `reynard-auth-core`, `reynard-auth-composables`
- [x] **Package Restructuring**: Updated `reynard-auth`, `reynard-connection`, `reynard-api-client` to use new architecture
- [x] **Build Verification**: All packages build successfully with new architecture
- [x] **Ecosystem Integration**: All new packages added to vitest workspace, pnpm workspace, and tsconfig
- [x] **Testing Integration**: All new packages have proper test setup and build verification
- [x] **Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive documentation created for all new packages
- [x] **Examples Updated**: All examples updated to use new package structure
- [x] **Final Integration Test**: Complete ecosystem test passed successfully

## 🎉 **PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!**

All authentication restructuring tasks have been completed. The new modular architecture is fully implemented, tested, and documented. The system now has:

- ✅ **Clean layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Eliminated circular dependencies** through proper package structure
- ✅ **Framework-agnostic core** that can be used with any framework
- ✅ **SolidJS-specific composables** for reactive authentication state
- ✅ **Robust HTTP client** with middleware, retry logic, and circuit breaker patterns
- ✅ **Full backward compatibility** maintained through unified interface
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** and build verification
- ✅ **Complete documentation** with usage examples and best practices

### Key Benefits

1. **Clear separation of concerns** - Each package has a single responsibility
2. **Eliminated circular dependencies** - Clean dependency graph
3. **Improved maintainability** - Easier to test and modify individual components
4. **Better reusability** - Components can be used independently
5. **Enhanced performance** - Smaller bundle sizes and better tree-shaking
6. **Future-proof architecture** - Easy to extend and modify

### Migration Strategy

1. **Gradual migration** - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
2. **Incremental testing** - Test each package as it's created/updated
3. **Documentation updates** - Update docs as packages are created
4. **Example updates** - Update examples to use new architecture
5. **Performance monitoring** - Ensure no performance regressions

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Create foundation layer packages (`reynard-http-client`, `reynard-auth-core`)
2. **Proceed systematically** through each phase
3. **Test thoroughly** at each step
4. **Document changes** as they're made
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** throughout migration
6. **Verify ecosystem harmony** at completion
