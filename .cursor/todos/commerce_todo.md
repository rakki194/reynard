# ü¶Å Reynard Commerce Ecosystem - Enterprise Grade Implementation

**Success-Advisor-8 Strategic Commerce Development Plan**

_claws flex with systematic precision_

## üéØ **STRATEGIC COMMERCE STACK FOR REYNARD ECOSYSTEM**

## üîê RBAC Integration

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This TODO now integrates with the **ONE WAY: Unified RBAC System** quest in `one_way.md`.

### **RBAC Requirements**

- [ ] Define required roles for commerce access (Commerce Admin, Store Manager, Customer, Vendor)
- [ ] Identify resource permissions needed (create, read, update, delete, purchase, manage, audit)
- [ ] Plan context-specific access control (store-level, product-level, order-level permissions)
- [ ] Design audit trail requirements (purchases, inventory changes, access attempts)

### **Integration Points**

- [ ] Update commerce endpoints with RBAC middleware
- [ ] Add permission checks to commerce service layer
- [ ] Implement role-based commerce visibility
- [ ] Add audit logging for commerce access attempts

### **Testing Requirements**

- [ ] Test role-based commerce access control
- [ ] Verify permission inheritance for commerce operations
- [ ] Test context-specific permissions (public vs private commerce)
- [ ] Validate audit trail functionality for commerce operations

### **Current Infrastructure Assessment**

**‚úÖ Existing Strengths:**

- **SolidJS Frontend**: High-performance reactive framework
- **FastAPI Backend**: Robust API infrastructure with service orchestration
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Advanced database with vector search capabilities
- **Gatekeeper Authentication**: Enterprise-grade JWT auth with role-based access control
- **ECS World Simulation**: Agent management and trait inheritance system
- **MCP Server Integration**: 47 comprehensive development tools
- **Multi-modal AI Services**: RAG, caption generation, TTS, image processing

## üèóÔ∏è **ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER MODELING ARCHITECTURE**

_claws flex with systematic precision_

### **üéØ Strategic Implementation Approach**

**Separation of Concerns**: The enterprise customer modeling ECS world operates completely independently from our playful agent ECS world, ensuring:

- **Clean Architecture**: No mixing of customer analytics with agent roleplay systems
- **Enterprise Focus**: Dedicated to business-critical customer intelligence
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of customer records without agent system interference
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise data governance and privacy requirements
