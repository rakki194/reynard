## üö® **Critical Issues to Address First**

1. **NoOp Engine Bloat** - 488 lines for doing nothing is unacceptable
2. **Debug Logging** - 101 console.log statements in production code
3. **Bundle Size** - Likely 50KB+ when it should be <20KB
4. **Performance** - No actual optimizations, just monitoring
5. **Missing Features** - No gestures, scroll animations, timeline, SVG support

---

_ü¶ä Remember: The goal is to create a library that's actually competitive with anime.js, not just feature-complete for a niche framework. Focus on performance, simplicity, and real-world features that developers actually use._
