## 🦊 Strategic Notes

**Fox Cunning**: This consolidation requires strategic thinking - we're not just moving code, we're architecting a better system. Each component should be placed with purpose and elegance.

**Otter Thoroughness**: Every test must pass, every feature must work, every edge case must be considered. We're building something that will last.

**Wolf Aggression**: We're eliminating redundancy and creating a single source of truth. No mercy for duplicate code or unnecessary complexity.

_Let the consolidation begin! 🦊🦦🐺_
