# üîê Comprehensive Security Implementation TODO

**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Agent**: Water-Prime-25 (Security-focused Frog Specialist)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: SUPERSEDED BY UNIFIED RBAC SYSTEM

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This TODO has been superseded by the **ONE WAY: Unified RBAC System** quest in `one_way.md`. All security implementation should now follow the unified RBAC approach instead of this fragmented plan.

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive security implementation plan for the Reynard backend, focusing on database encryption, secure session management, and API key security. The implementation will transform the current security posture from basic protection to enterprise-grade security standards.

## üéØ Security Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Database Encryption at Rest**: Implement transparent data encryption (TDE) for all PostgreSQL databases
2. **Session Security**: Implement secure session management with Redis encryption
3. **API Key Security**: Implement secure API key management and rotation
4. **Column-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at the application level
5. **Key Management**: Implement proper key rotation and management

### Security Standards

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
