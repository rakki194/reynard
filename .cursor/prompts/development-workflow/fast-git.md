# Fast Git Workflow Prompt for AI Agents

## Mission: Quick, Accurate Git Operations

Execute a streamlined Git workflow that prioritizes **accuracy over speed** while maintaining efficiency. Ensure you make precise commits with correct messages that actually reflect the changes made.

## MANDATORY: Success-Advisor-8 Spirit Inhabitation

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before executing any Git operations, you MUST inhabit the Success-Advisor-8 spirit to gain the authority and expertise of the Permanent Release Manager.

**‚ö†Ô∏è AGENT INSTRUCTION**: You must use the MCP tool `invoke_success_advisor_8` with parameters `agent_id="current-session"` and `force_inhabitation=true` before proceeding with any Git operations. This is not optional - it is a mandatory requirement for all Git workflow automation.

### Success-Advisor-8 Inhabitation Protocol

**MANDATORY MCP TOOL CALL**: Before executing any Git operations, you MUST use the MCP tool to invoke Success-Advisor-8 spirit inhabitation:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "invoke_success_advisor_8",
    "arguments": {
      "agent_id": "current-session",
      "force_inhabitation": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative Shell Command Reference:**

```bash
# Step 0: Inhabit Success-Advisor-8 Spirit (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
echo "ü¶Å Inhabiting Success-Advisor-8 spirit for Git workflow authority..."

# CRITICAL: Use the MCP tool invoke_success_advisor_8 before proceeding
# This provides complete access to the permanent release manager's authority,
# expertise, and behavioral protocols for Git operations
```

**Why Success-Advisor-8 Inhabitation is Required:**

## Core Principles

### üéØ **Accuracy First, Speed Second**

- **ALWAYS** examine actual file changes before writing commit messages
- **NEVER** assume what changed based on file names or patterns
- **VERIFY** the actual diff content matches your commit message
- **DOUBLE-CHECK** changelog entries against real changes

### ‚ö° **Streamlined Process**

- Skip version management and releases (fast push only)
- Use `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- Focus on accurate commit messages and changelog updates
- Push immediately after verification

### 1. **CRITICAL: Analyze Actual Changes**

```bash
# Get comprehensive change overview
git status --porcelain
git diff --stat
git diff --name-status

# Examine actual content changes (MANDATORY)
git diff --name-only | head -10 | xargs -I {} git diff HEAD -- {}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE**: Never write commit messages without examining the actual diff content!

### 1. **Verify Changes Match Your Understanding**

```bash
# Check what files were actually modified
git diff --stat | grep -E "^ [0-9]+ files? changed"

# Look at specific file changes
git diff HEAD -- <filename>

# Verify deletions and additions
git diff --name-status | grep -E "^[AD]"
```

### 2. **Update CHANGELOG.md (If Needed)**

**Only update CHANGELOG.md if there are significant changes worth documenting.**

```bash
# Check if CHANGELOG.md needs updates
git diff HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md

# If updating, add entries that match ACTUAL changes
# Use format: "- **Brief Description**: What actually changed (Agent-Name)"
```

### 3. **Stage and Commit with Accurate Message**

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Write commit message based on ACTUAL changes
git commit --no-verify -m "type: accurate description of what actually changed

- List only the changes that actually occurred
- Be specific about what was modified, added, or removed
- Reference actual file names and changes
- Keep descriptions factual and precise

This commit represents [actual summary of changes]."
```

### 4. **Push Immediately**

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin main

# If amending previous commit, use force push
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Error Prevention Checklist

### ‚úÖ **Before Writing Commit Message**

- [ ] Examined `git diff --stat` output
- [ ] Checked `git diff --name-status` for file types
- [ ] Looked at actual content changes with `git diff`
- [ ] Verified what was added, modified, or deleted
- [ ] Confirmed changes match your understanding

### ‚úÖ **Before Committing**

- [ ] Commit message describes actual changes
- [ ] No fictional features or components mentioned
- [ ] File names and changes are accurate

- [ ] Ready to push with `--no-verify` flag

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå **NEVER Do These**

- Write commit messages without checking actual diffs
- Assume changes based on file names
- Mention features that weren't actually implemented
- Reference components that weren't modified
- Create fictional changelog entries
- Use generic commit messages like "various updates"

### ‚ùå **Example of BAD Commit Message**

```text
feat: comprehensive E2E testing framework and monitoring system

- Added advanced effects testing with comprehensive monitoring
- Implemented dependency fixtures and unified results management
- Enhanced ecosystem documentation with latest capabilities

# PROBLEM: This describes changes that never happened!
```

### ‚úÖ **Example of GOOD Commit Message**

```text
feat: research prompt system reorganization and enhancement

- Enhanced academic-review-prompt.md with improved evaluation frameworks
- Added implementation-guide.md for research methodology guidance
- Added novelty-verification-prompt.md for contribution assessment
- Removed redundant enhanced-academic-review-prompt.md

# GOOD: This accurately describes what actually changed
```

#!/bin/bash
# Fast Git Workflow for AI Agents

echo "ü¶ä Starting Fast Git Workflow..."

# Step 0: Success-Advisor-8 Spirit Inhabitation (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
echo "ü¶Å Inhabiting Success-Advisor-8 spirit for Git workflow authority..."
echo "   This provides complete access to the permanent release manager's authority,"
echo "   expertise, and behavioral protocols for Git operations"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Agent must use MCP tool before proceeding:"
echo "   Tool: invoke_success_advisor_8"
echo "   Arguments: agent_id='current-session', force_inhabitation=true"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Success-Advisor-8 spirit inhabitation required before proceeding"

# Step 1: Analyze actual changes
echo "üìä Analyzing changes..."
git status --porcelain
git diff --stat
git diff --name-status

# Step 2: Show sample of actual changes with Delta
echo "üîç Sample of actual changes (using Delta):"
git diff --name-only | head -5 | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "=== {} ===" && git diff HEAD -- {} | head -20'

# Step 2b: Show full diff with Delta for analysis
echo "üìã Full diff for analysis:"
git diff

# Step 3: Wait for agent to write accurate commit message
echo "‚è≥ Please examine the changes above and write an accurate commit message"
echo "   Remember: Only describe what actually changed!"

# Step 4: Stage and commit
echo "üìù Staging changes..."
git add .

# Step 5: Commit with --no-verify
echo "üíæ Committing with --no-verify..."
# Agent should replace this with actual commit message
git commit --no-verify -m "REPLACE_WITH_ACCURATE_MESSAGE"

# Step 6: Push
echo "üöÄ Pushing to remote..."
git push origin main

echo "‚úÖ Fast Git workflow completed!"
```

## Success Criteria

The workflow is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ **Accurate Analysis**: Agent examined actual file changes before writing commit message
2. ‚úÖ **Precise Message**: Commit message describes only what actually changed
3. ‚úÖ **Factual Changelog**: Any changelog entries match real changes
4. ‚úÖ **Clean Push**: Changes pushed successfully to remote
5. ‚úÖ **No Fiction**: No mention of features or changes that didn't occur

## Emergency Fixes

### **If You Made an Inaccurate Commit**

```bash
# Amend the commit message
git commit --amend --no-verify -m "corrected: accurate description of changes"

# Force push the corrected commit
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
