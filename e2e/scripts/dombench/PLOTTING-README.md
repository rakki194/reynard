## Chart Types Explained

### Render Time Performance

Shows how render time scales with component count for each approach:

- **CSR (Blue)**: Client-Side Rendering - direct DOM manipulation
- **Lazy (Green)**: Lazy Loading - placeholder replacement
- **Virtual (Yellow)**: Virtual Scrolling - only visible items
- **Batch (Red)**: Batch Rendering - chunked creation

### Memory Usage Analysis

Displays memory consumption patterns:

- Shows memory delta during rendering
- Helps identify memory-efficient approaches
- Useful for large-scale applications

### DOM Nodes Analysis

Visualizes DOM node creation:

- Shows actual DOM nodes created
- Virtual scrolling shows minimal nodes
- Helps understand DOM complexity

### Scaling Analysis

Time per component efficiency:

- Shows how approaches scale with size
- Virtual scrolling maintains constant time
- Identifies performance bottlenecks

### Performance Comparison

Side-by-side comparison of all approaches:

- Easy visual comparison
- Identifies best approach for each scenario
- Shows performance trade-offs

### Category Breakdown

Performance by component category:

- Primitives, Layouts, Data, Overlays
- Shows which components are most expensive
- Helps optimize component design

### Efficiency Analysis

Components per millisecond throughput:

- Shows rendering efficiency
- Higher values = better performance
- Useful for high-throughput scenarios

## Performance Insights

## Usage Examples

### Generate Plots from Specific Results

```bash
pnpm exec tsx plot-benchmark-results.ts /path/to/results.json
```

### View Plots Only

## Technical Details

### Chart.js Integration

- Uses Chart.js 4.x for modern chart rendering
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Interactive tooltips and animations
- Professional color schemes

### Playwright Browser Automation

## Customization

### Color Schemes

Modify colors in `getApproachColors()` and `getCategoryColors()`:

```typescript
private getApproachColors(): Array<{ border: string; background: string }> {
  return [
    { border: '#007acc', background: 'rgba(0, 122, 204, 0.1)' }, // CSR - Blue
    { border: '#28a745', background: 'rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.1)' }, // Lazy - Green
    // ... more colors
  ];
}
```

### Chart Types

Change chart types in individual plot methods:

```typescript
const html = this.createChartHTML(
  "Chart Title",
  "X Axis Label",
  "Y Axis Label",
  plotData,
  "line" // or "bar", "doughnut", etc.
);
```

### Browser Settings

Modify browser launch options:

```typescript
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: false, // Show browser
  slowMo: 1000, // Slow down for viewing
  devtools: true, // Open dev tools
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Won't Launch

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
pnpm exec playwright install
```

### File URLs Not Working

- Ensure absolute paths are used
- Check file permissions
- Verify file existence

### Charts Not Rendering

- Check Chart.js CDN availability
- Verify HTML structure
- Check browser console for errors

### Screenshots Not Saving

- Check write permissions
- Verify directory exists
- Check disk space

## Best Practices

### Performance Analysis

1. **Run multiple iterations** for statistical significance
2. **Test different component counts** to understand scaling
3. **Compare approaches** side-by-side
4. **Consider memory usage** alongside render time
5. **Test with real data** not just synthetic benchmarks

### Chart Interpretation

1. **Look for trends** not just absolute values
2. **Consider scaling behavior** for large datasets
3. **Balance performance** with user experience
4. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
5. **Validate with real applications**

### Documentation

1. **Save screenshots** for reports and documentation
2. **Include context** about test conditions
3. **Document findings** and recommendations
4. **Share results** with team members
5. **Track performance** over time

## Integration with CI/CD

# Run in CI pipeline
pnpm exec tsx focused-dombench.ts
pnpm exec tsx plot-benchmark-results.ts
# Upload results to artifact storage
```

### Performance Regression Testing

# Compare with baseline
pnpm exec tsx plot-benchmark-results.ts baseline-results.json
pnpm exec tsx plot-benchmark-results.ts current-results.json
# Generate comparison report
```
