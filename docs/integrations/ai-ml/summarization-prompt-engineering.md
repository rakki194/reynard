# Summarization Prompt Engineering Best Practices

This guide covers best practices for designing and optimizing prompts for the summarization system in YipYap. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for generating high-quality, relevant, and useful summaries.

## Overview

The summarization system uses a modular prompt architecture with specialized templates for different content types and summary levels. Understanding how to design and optimize these prompts is essential for achieving the best summarization results.

## Prompt Architecture

### System Prompt Structure

The summarization system uses a two-part prompt structure:

1. **System Prompt**: Defines the role, capabilities, and constraints
2. **User Prompt**: Contains the specific content and instructions

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt.format(text=content)}
]
```

### Content Type Specialization

Each content type has specialized prompts optimized for its characteristics:

- **Article Prompts**: Focus on key points, arguments, and author perspective
- **Code Prompts**: Emphasize functionality, structure, and technical details
- **Document Prompts**: Preserve structure, findings, and formal tone
- **Technical Prompts**: Maintain accuracy and technical precision
- **General Prompts**: Balanced approach for mixed content

## Prompt Design Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

**Good Example:**

```plaintext
You are an expert summarizer specializing in technical documentation.
Your task is to create a comprehensive summary that:
- Preserves technical accuracy
- Maintains logical structure
- Highlights key specifications
- Uses precise technical terminology
- Includes relevant code examples when present
```

**Poor Example:**

```plaintext
Summarize this text well.
```

### 2. Role Definition

Clearly define the summarizer's role and expertise:

```python
system_prompt = """
You are an expert {content_type} summarizer with deep knowledge in {domain}.
Your expertise includes:
- {expertise_area_1}
- {expertise_area_2}
- {expertise_area_3}

Your summaries are known for their {quality_characteristics}.
"""
```

### 3. Output Structure

Define clear output structure and format:

```python
system_prompt = """
Generate a summary with the following structure:
1. Main Points: 2-3 key takeaways
2. Detailed Summary: {word_count} words covering essential content
3. Key Highlights: 3-5 important points
4. Technical Details: Relevant specifications and requirements
5. Conclusions: Main findings and implications

Format the output in clear, readable paragraphs with proper structure.
"""
```

### 4. Quality Criteria

Specify quality standards and evaluation criteria:

```python
system_prompt = """
Your summary must meet these quality criteria:
- Coherence: Logical flow and clear structure
- Completeness: Cover all essential information
- Accuracy: Preserve factual correctness
- Relevance: Focus on important content
- Clarity: Use clear, accessible language
- Conciseness: Eliminate redundancy while maintaining completeness
"""
```

## Content Type Specific Prompts

"""
```

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Learning

Include examples to guide the model:

```python
few_shot_system_prompt = """
You are an expert article summarizer. Here are examples of good summaries:

Example 1:
Original: "Machine learning algorithms can predict stock prices with 70% accuracy..."
Summary: "This article discusses machine learning applications in financial markets, specifically stock price prediction. The research shows 70% accuracy using neural networks and highlights the potential for automated trading systems."

Example 2:
Original: "Climate change impacts are accelerating faster than predicted..."
Summary: "Recent studies indicate climate change effects are occurring more rapidly than previous models suggested. The article presents new data showing accelerated temperature increases and discusses implications for policy and adaptation strategies."

Now summarize the following article following the same style and approach:

{text}
"""
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Guide the model through reasoning steps:

```python
cot_system_prompt = """
You are an expert summarizer. When creating summaries, follow these steps:

1. First, identify the main topic and purpose of the content
2. Next, identify the key arguments, points, or findings
3. Then, determine the most important supporting details
4. Finally, organize the information into a coherent summary

For each step, briefly explain your reasoning before proceeding to the next step.

Content to summarize:
{text}
"""
```

### 3. Constraint-Based Prompting

Set specific constraints and requirements:

```python
constraint_system_prompt = """
You are an expert summarizer with specific constraints:

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum length: {max_words} words
- Must include: {required_elements}
- Must avoid: {forbidden_elements}
- Tone: {tone_requirement}
- Structure: {structure_requirement}

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Accuracy: {accuracy_requirement}
- Completeness: {completeness_requirement}
- Clarity: {clarity_requirement}

Generate a summary that meets all constraints and requirements:

{text}
"""
```

## Prompt Optimization Strategies

### 1. A/B Testing

Test different prompt variations:

```python
# Version A: Direct instruction
prompt_a = "Summarize this text in 200 words."

# Version B: Role-based instruction
prompt_b = "You are an expert summarizer. Create a 200-word summary of this text."

# Version C: Detailed instruction
prompt_c = """
You are an expert summarizer. Your task is to create a 200-word summary that:
- Captures the main points
- Maintains clarity and readability
- Preserves important details
- Uses clear, concise language

Text to summarize:
{text}
"""
```

### 2. Parameter Tuning

Optimize generation parameters:

```python
# Conservative settings for factual content
conservative_params = {
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 500
}

# Creative settings for narrative content
creative_params = {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "max_tokens": 500
}

# Balanced settings for general content
balanced_params = {
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "top_p": 0.85,
    "max_tokens": 500
}
```

### 3. Context Enhancement

Add relevant context to improve results:

```python
enhanced_user_prompt = """
Context: This is a technical article about machine learning algorithms.

Please summarize the following text:

{text}

Consider the technical nature of the content and ensure accuracy in technical terms and concepts.
"""
```

## Quality Assessment Prompts

### Self-Evaluation Prompts

Ask the model to evaluate its own output:

```python
evaluation_prompt = """
After generating the summary, evaluate its quality:

1. Does it capture the main points accurately?
2. Is it complete and comprehensive?
3. Is it clear and well-structured?
4. Does it maintain the original tone and style?
5. Are there any important details missing?

Provide a brief quality assessment and suggest any improvements.
"""
```

### Quality Metrics Prompts

Generate specific quality metrics:

```python
metrics_prompt = """
Rate the following summary on these metrics (0-1 scale):

1. Coherence: How well does the summary flow logically?
2. Completeness: How much of the important content is covered?
3. Accuracy: How accurately does it represent the original content?
4. Clarity: How clear and readable is the summary?
5. Relevance: How focused is it on important information?

Summary to evaluate:
{summary}

Provide scores and brief explanations for each metric.
"""
```

## Prompt Maintenance and Updates

### 1. Regular Evaluation

Establish a process for regular prompt evaluation:

```python
evaluation_checklist = [
    "Are prompts producing consistent results?",
    "Are quality metrics meeting targets?",
    "Are user feedback scores positive?",
    "Are there new content types to support?",
    "Are there performance issues to address?"
]
```

### 2. Version Control

Maintain prompt versions for tracking changes:

```python
prompt_version = {
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "changes": [
        "Enhanced code summarizer prompts",
        "Added few-shot examples",
        "Improved quality assessment prompts"
    ],
    "performance_metrics": {
        "coherence_score": 0.88,
        "completeness_score": 0.92,
        "user_satisfaction": 0.85
    }
}
```

### 3. Continuous Improvement

Implement feedback loops for prompt improvement:

```python
improvement_process = {
    "collect_feedback": "Gather user feedback and quality metrics",
    "analyze_patterns": "Identify common issues and improvement areas",
    "test_variations": "Create and test prompt variations",
    "measure_impact": "Compare performance of new prompts",
    "deploy_updates": "Roll out improved prompts",
    "monitor_results": "Track performance and user satisfaction"
}
```
