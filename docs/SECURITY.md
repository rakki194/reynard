# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Reynard framework and
provides guidance for secure development practices.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token storage using sessionStorage for access tokens and localStorage for refresh tokens
- **Token Validation**: Client-side token format validation with server-side signature verification required
- **CSRF Protection**: Automatic CSRF token generation and validation for state-changing requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Secure Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation utilities

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Comprehensive Input Sanitization**: Multi-layer input sanitization to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type validation, size limits, and content scanning
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **MIME Type Validation**: Verification that file extensions match actual content

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic HTTPS enforcement in production environments
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Connection Security**: Secure connection management with circuit breakers and retry logic

### Error Handling

- **Information Disclosure Prevention**: Sanitized error messages that don't expose sensitive system information
- **Structured Logging**: Security events logged without exposing sensitive data
- **Graceful Degradation**: Secure fallback mechanisms for error conditions

## Security Headers

The framework automatically applies the following security headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables browser XSS filtering
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS connections
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information leakage
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser feature access

## File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types

- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- Documents: PDF, TXT
- Data: JSON, XML

### Security Measures

- File size limits (10MB production, 50MB development)
- MIME type validation
- Content scanning for malicious patterns
- Path traversal prevention
- Executable file blocking

## Development Security

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Development

- More permissive CSP policies
- Larger file upload limits
- Disabled rate limiting
- HTTP allowed for local development

#### Production

- Strict CSP policies
- Smaller file upload limits
- Active rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement
- Enhanced logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always validate input** on both client and server side
2. **Use the provided sanitization functions** for all user input
3. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
4. **Use HTTPS in production** environments
5. **Regularly update dependencies** and run security audits
6. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for user permissions
7. **Implement proper session management** with secure token handling

### For Deployment

1. **Enable all security headers** in your web server configuration
2. **Use a reverse proxy** (nginx, Apache) with proper security configurations
3. **Implement proper SSL/TLS** with strong cipher suites
4. **Regular security audits** using `npm run security:check`
5. **Monitor for security events** and implement alerting
6. **Keep dependencies updated** and scan for vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Email** security concerns to: <acsipont@gmail.com>
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow** reasonable time for response before public disclosure

## Security Commands

```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security:check

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm run audit:fix

# Check for high-severity vulnerabilities
npm run audit
```

## Dependencies

The framework uses the following security-focused dependencies:

- `jwt-decode`: Secure JWT token decoding
- `@zxcvbn-ts/core`: Password strength validation
- `audit-ci`: Automated vulnerability scanning

## Compliance

The framework is designed to help applications meet common security standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **CIS Controls**: Implementation of critical security controls
- **GDPR**: Privacy-focused design with secure data handling
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service organizations

## Updates

This security policy is regularly updated to reflect new threats and
security measures. Please check back periodically for updates.
