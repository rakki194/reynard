### Spatial Partitioning Optimization

The PAW spatial collision optimizer implements a sophisticated multi-level spatial hashing approach:

```typescript
export class SpatialCollisionOptimizer {
  private spatialHash: SpatialHash<{ aabb: AABB; index: number }>;
  private config: SpatialCollisionConfig;
  private collisionCache: CollisionCache;
  private stats: SpatialCollisionStats;

  detectCollisions(aabbs: AABB[]): CollisionPair[] {
    // Choose algorithm based on object count
    const collisions = aabbs.length < this.config.hybridThreshold
      ? this.naiveCollisionDetection(aabbs)
      : this.spatialCollisionDetection(aabbs);
    
    return collisions;
  }
}
```

### Batch Union-Find Operations

Enhanced Union-Find implementation with batch processing capabilities:

```typescript
export class BatchUnionFind extends UnionFind {
  private batchSize: number;
  private pendingUnions: Array<[number, number]> = [];

  batchUnion(pairs: Array<[number, number]>): void {
    this.pendingUnions.push(...pairs);
    
    if (this.pendingUnions.length >= this.batchSize) {
      this.processBatch();
    }
  }
}
```

### Hybrid Performance Management

Intelligent algorithm selection based on real-time workload analysis:

```typescript
function selectOptimalAlgorithm(objects: AABB[], workloadHistory: WorkloadStats): AlgorithmType {
  const objectCount = objects.length;
  const density = calculateSpatialDensity(objects);
  const complexity = estimateComplexity(objectCount, density);
