## Running Benchmarks

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript (for development)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
node run-benchmarks.js

# View results
cat benchmark-results.json

### Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark suite can be configured through the `config` object:

```javascript
const config = {
  iterations: 100,           // Number of benchmark iterations
  warmupRounds: 10,         // Warmup rounds before timing
  objectCounts: [10, 25, 50, 100, 200],  // Object count scenarios
  overlapDensities: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7], // Overlap density scenarios
  spatialConfigs: [         // Spatial hash configurations
    { cellSize: 50, maxObjectsPerCell: 25 },
    { cellSize: 100, maxObjectsPerCell: 50 },
    { cellSize: 200, maxObjectsPerCell: 100 },
  ],
};
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

**Spatial Collision Detection**

```typescript
export class SpatialCollisionOptimizer {
  detectCollisions(aabbs: AABB[]): CollisionPair[] {
    const collisions = aabbs.length < this.config.hybridThreshold
      ? this.naiveCollisionDetection(aabbs)
      : this.spatialCollisionDetection(aabbs);
    return collisions;
  }
}
```

**Batch Union-Find Operations**

```typescript
export class BatchUnionFind extends UnionFind {
  batchUnion(pairs: Array<[number, number]>): void {
    this.pendingUnions.push(...pairs);
    if (this.pendingUnions.length >= this.batchSize) {
      this.processBatch();
    }
  }
}
```

**Hybrid Algorithm Selection**

```typescript
function selectOptimalAlgorithm(objects: AABB[]): AlgorithmType {
  const complexity = estimateComplexity(objects.length, calculateDensity(objects));
  if (complexity < T_naive) return AlgorithmType.Naive;
  if (complexity < T_spatial) return AlgorithmType.Spatial;
  return AlgorithmType.UnionFind;
}
```
