# Reynard Framework Documentation 🦊

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Reynard framework - a cunning SolidJS framework with modular architecture, built for modern web applications. This documentation reflects the current state of the Reynard ecosystem with its 25+ specialized packages.

> _From dataset editor to multi-modal CMS: The evolution of a cunning framework_

Reynard is a SolidJS framework derived from **yipyap**, a multi-modal content management system. The framework extracts and modularizes yipyap's proven architectural patterns into reusable packages for modern web development.

## 🦦 Architecture Evolution

### **yipyap: Full-Stack Multi-Modal CMS**

**yipyap** (Your Intuitive Platform for Yielding, Annotating, and Processing) is a complete full-stack content management system. Its backend is built with Python and FastAPI, providing robust AI/ML services, a RAG system, vector databases, NLWeb routing, and Diffusion LLM integration. The frontend leverages SolidJS, offering a comprehensive suite of UI components, theming capabilities, and real-time features.

For content processing, yipyap supports a wide range of formats, including images, videos, audio, documents, and other specialized types. Model integration is a core strength, with support for JTP2, WDv3, Florence-2, JoyCaption, YOLO, OWLv2, and custom model implementations. Enterprise-level services such as text-to-speech (TTS), web crawling, vector databases, and various API integrations are also included.

yipyap employs a monolithic architecture, featuring a tightly integrated frontend and backend with shared state management for seamless operation.

### **Reynard: Modular Framework Extraction**

Reynard extracts yipyap's proven patterns into a highly modular framework where each component can be used independently:

The current Reynard frontend is built on a modular architecture, comprising over 25 specialized packages with minimal dependencies. Performance is a key focus, achieved through bundle splitting, lazy loading, and intelligent caching strategies. The theming system leverages CSS custom properties, offering eight built-in themes as well as support for custom themes. Internationalization is robust, with support for 37 languages, right-to-left (RTL) capabilities, and locale-aware formatting. Accessibility is prioritized, ensuring WCAG 2.1 compliance, ARIA labels, and full keyboard navigation. Type safety is enforced throughout the codebase, with comprehensive TypeScript coverage and detailed type definitions.

On the backend, Reynard is planning a modular suite of services. Each core function—AI/ML, content processing, and database management—will be delivered as an independent, installable package. The architecture will allow for flexible API composition, enabling developers to mix and match services according to their application's needs. Service discovery will be dynamic, supporting automatic registration and health monitoring. Each service will be able to scale independently, allowing the system to efficiently handle varying workloads and demand.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### **🎯 Multi-Modal Content Management**

Reynard inherits yipyap's sophisticated content management capabilities, offering advanced solutions for a wide range of media types. For images, Reynard provides powerful processing features such as advanced thumbnail generation, metadata extraction, and seamless format conversion. Video support is equally comprehensive, enabling detailed video processing with preview generation and in-depth metadata analysis.

Audio handling in Reynard is robust, supporting multiple formats and offering features like waveform visualization and thorough metadata extraction. Document processing is also a core strength, with the ability to handle PDFs, Office documents, and text files, all while performing intelligent content analysis.

At the heart of these capabilities is AI-powered analysis, which enables automatic content analysis, tagging, and classification, ensuring that all types of content are organized and discoverable with cunning efficiency.

### **🤖 AI/ML Integration**

Reynard is built on yipyap's proven AI infrastructure, offering a robust suite of intelligent features. Caption generation is powered by multiple AI models—including JTP2, WDv3, Florence-2, and JoyCaption—with support for efficient batch processing. Smart tagging enables automatic tag generation, complete with confidence scoring and the flexibility to incorporate custom models.

The framework includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, leveraging vector databases and semantic search to enhance content discovery and analysis. For object detection, Reynard integrates models such as YOLO, OWLv2, and Florence-2, providing advanced bounding box annotation capabilities.

Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality is also available, supporting multiple voice options and a wide range of languages to ensure accessibility and versatility.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Reynard is guided by the "cunning fox" philosophy. The framework values smart, elegant solutions over unnecessary complexity, aiming to be adaptable so it can integrate seamlessly with your existing patterns. It is resourceful, minimizing dependencies while maximizing functionality, and maintains a professional standard with high expectations for code quality and naming conventions.

## 📦 Package Ecosystem

Reynard's package ecosystem is built on the foundation of yipyap's proven architecture, with each package designed to be independently useful while working seamlessly together. All packages are published to npm and ready for production use!
