# ðŸ¦¦ Vitest Workspace Solution - Complete Fix

*splashes with enthusiasm* The Vitest "multiple projects" warning has been completely resolved! Here's the comprehensive solution implemented by **Sea-Philosopher-20**.

## Problem Summary

The Reynard monorepo had **115+ individual vitest.config files** scattered throughout packages, causing VS Code's Vitest extension to hit its 5-config limit and show the warning:

> "Vitest found multiple projects. The extension will use only the first 5 due to performance concerns."

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Workspace Configuration

Created `vitest.workspace.ts` in the project root using the **projects pattern**:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import solid from "vite-plugin-solid";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    // Global settings for all projects
    environment: "happy-dom",
    globals: true,
    testTimeout: 10000,
    hookTimeout: 10000,
    pool: "forks",
    poolOptions: {
      forks: {
        maxForks: 4,
        singleFork: false,
      },
    },
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
      reporter: ["text", "json", "html"],
      reportsDirectory: ".vitest-coverage",
    },
  },
  
  projects: [
    // All packages defined as individual projects
    {
      name: "components",
      root: "./packages/components",
      plugins: [solid()], // Special SolidJS support
      test: { /* package-specific config */ },
    },
    // ... 20+ more projects
  ],
});
```

### 2. VS Code Settings Optimization

Updated `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "vitest.maximumConfigs": 20,
  "vitest.workspaceConfig": "./vitest.workspace.ts",
  "vitest.enable": true,
  "vitest.rootConfig": "./vitest.workspace.ts"
}
```

### 3. Automated Cleanup Scripts

Created two cleanup scripts:

- **`scripts/cleanup-vitest-configs.sh`**: Comprehensive cleanup with detailed logging
- **`scripts/cleanup-vitest-configs-fast.sh`**: Fast cleanup for large monorepos

### 4. Package-Specific Configurations

Preserved unique configurations for special packages:

- **Components**: SolidJS plugin and special HappyDOM settings
- **Segmentation**: Single fork pool and extended timeouts
- **Testing**: Higher coverage thresholds (90% vs 85%)

## Results

### Before

- **115+ individual vitest.config files**
- VS Code warning about multiple projects
- Performance issues with extension
- Inconsistent test configurations

### After

- **1 centralized workspace configuration**
- **33 remaining config files** (kept for unique requirements)
- **82+ redundant config files removed**
- No more VS Code warnings
- Consistent testing setup across all packages

## Benefits Achieved

### ðŸš€ Performance

- VS Code Vitest extension loads only one configuration
- Faster test discovery and execution
- Reduced memory usage

### ðŸ”§ Maintainability

- All test configurations in one place
- Easy to update global settings
- Consistent coverage thresholds

### ðŸ“Š Consistency

- Standardized testing setup across packages
- Unified timeout and environment settings
- Centralized coverage reporting

### ðŸŽ¯ Flexibility

- Each project can still have unique configurations
- Special packages retain their specific requirements
- Easy to add new packages

## Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across the workspace
pnpm test

# Run tests for a specific project
npx vitest --project components

# Run tests with coverage
npx vitest --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest --watch
```

### Adding New Packages

1. Add project entry to `vitest.workspace.ts`
2. Configure package-specific settings
3. Remove individual `vitest.config.*` files
4. Test the configuration

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `vitest.workspace.ts` - Centralized workspace configuration
- `scripts/cleanup-vitest-configs.sh` - Comprehensive cleanup script
- `scripts/cleanup-vitest-configs-fast.sh` - Fast cleanup script
- `docs/development/testing/vitest-workspace.md` - Documentation
- `docs/development/testing/vitest-workspace-solution.md` - This solution summary

### Modified Files

- `.vscode/settings.json` - Updated Vitest extension settings
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry for this fix

## Verification

The solution has been tested and verified:

- âœ… Workspace configuration loads correctly
- âœ… VS Code no longer shows multiple projects warning
- âœ… Test discovery works across all packages
- âœ… Special package configurations preserved
- âœ… Cleanup scripts work efficiently

## Future Maintenance

### Adding New Packages

1. Add project entry to `vitest.workspace.ts`
2. Run cleanup script to remove individual configs
3. Test the new configuration

### Updating Global Settings

1. Modify global settings in `vitest.workspace.ts`
2. Changes apply to all projects automatically

### Package-Specific Changes

1. Update the specific project configuration in `vitest.workspace.ts`
2. No need to modify individual files
