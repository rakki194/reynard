# ü¶ä Reynard Framework Overview

> _From dataset editor to multi-modal CMS: The evolution of a cunning framework_

Reynard is a SolidJS framework derived from **YipYap**, a multi-modal content management system. The framework extracts and modularizes YipYap's proven architectural patterns into reusable packages for modern web development.

## ü¶¶ Architecture Evolution

### **YipYap: Full-Stack Multi-Modal CMS**

**YipYap** (Your Intuitive Platform for Yielding, Annotating, and Processing) is a complete full-stack content management system with:

- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI with AI/ML services, RAG system, vector databases, NLWeb routing, Diffusion LLM integration
- **Frontend**: SolidJS with comprehensive UI components, theming, and real-time features
- **Content Processing**: Multi-format support for images, videos, audio, documents, and specialized formats
- **Model Integration**: JTP2, WDv3, Florence-2, JoyCaption, YOLO, OWLv2, and custom model implementations
- **Enterprise Services**: TTS, web crawling, vector databases, and API integrations
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Tightly integrated frontend and backend with shared state management

### **Reynard: Modular Framework Extraction**

Reynard extracts YipYap's proven patterns into a highly modular framework where each component can be used independently:

**Frontend (Current)**:

- **Modular Architecture**: 25+ specialized packages with minimal dependencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle splitting, lazy loading, and intelligent caching
- **Theming System**: CSS custom properties with 8 built-in themes and custom theme support
- **Internationalization**: 37-language support with RTL capabilities and locale-aware formatting
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with comprehensive type definitions

**Backend (Planned)**:

- **Modular Services**: Independent AI/ML, content processing, and database services
- **Package-Based Architecture**: Each backend service as a separate, installable package
- **API Composition**: Mix and match services based on application requirements
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and health monitoring
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale individual services based on demand
