# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made for the Reynard framework.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help maintain a historical record of why certain decisions were made and provide guidance for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded)
- **Context**: The situation and problem being addressed
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Compliance**: How to ensure adherence to the decision

## Current ADRs

### ADR-001: Modularity Standards

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-15  
**Summary**: Establishes the 100-line axiom and modular architecture patterns for the Reynard framework.

### ADR-002: TypeScript Modularity Refactoring

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Summary**: Defines comprehensive TypeScript modularity standards, type safety practices, and refactoring strategies to address function length violations and type safety issues.

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR file** following the naming convention: `XXX-decision-title.md`
2. **Use the standard ADR template** with all required sections
3. **Update this README** to include the new ADR
4. **Get team review** before marking as "Accepted"
5. **Update related documentation** to reference the new ADR

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status

**Proposed** - YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

[Describe the situation and problem being addressed]

## Decision

[Describe the architectural decision made]

## Consequences

### Positive
[List positive outcomes]

### Negative
[List negative outcomes]

### Risks and Mitigations
[Identify risks and how they're mitigated]

## Compliance
