"""ðŸ¦Š Modular Middleware System for Reynard Backend

This module provides a comprehensive, modular middleware system organized by
semantic categories with clear separation of concerns and reusable components.

Architecture:
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration and validation
- Security: Security headers, input validation, and threat detection
- Rate Limiting: Adaptive and static rate limiting with bypass support
- Development: Development-specific middleware and testing support
- Core: Base middleware classes and orchestration

Key Features:
- Semantic organization by functional area
- Modular, reusable components
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Comprehensive security integration
- Development and testing support
- Performance monitoring and analytics
