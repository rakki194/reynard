"""
Development Bypass Middleware for Fenrir Testing Suite

This middleware provides a secure development bypass system that allows
the Reynard fenrir testing suite to bypass rate limiting and other
security restrictions ONLY when running in development mode from localhost.

Security Features:
- Only works in development environment
- Only allows localhost connections
- Requires specific fenrir user agent
- Logs all bypassed requests for audit
- Automatically disabled in production

This ensures our security testing doesn't interfere with production
security while allowing comprehensive testing in development.
