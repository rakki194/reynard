"""ü¶ä Reynard Backend Lifespan Management System
=============================================

Sophisticated service lifecycle management system for the Reynard FastAPI backend,
providing comprehensive orchestration of service initialization, health monitoring,
and graceful shutdown procedures. This module implements enterprise-grade lifecycle
management with dependency-aware startup sequencing and parallel execution optimization.

The lifespan manager provides:
- Priority-based service initialization with dependency resolution
- Parallel execution within priority groups for optimal startup performance
- Comprehensive health monitoring and service status tracking
- Graceful shutdown procedures with timeout handling and resource cleanup
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms with detailed logging
- Service registry integration for centralized lifecycle management

Key Features:
- Dependency-Aware Startup: Services start in correct order based on dependencies
- Parallel Initialization: Services within same priority group start concurrently
- Health Monitoring: Continuous health checks and service status tracking
- Graceful Shutdown: Proper resource cleanup with configurable timeouts
- Error Recovery: Comprehensive error handling with service isolation
- Performance Optimization: Startup time optimization through parallel execution

Architecture Components:
- Service Registry: Centralized service lifecycle management
- Priority System: Dependency-based startup sequencing
- Health Monitoring: Continuous service health checks
- Shutdown Orchestration: Graceful resource cleanup
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error recovery and reporting

The lifespan manager ensures reliable service startup and shutdown while
maintaining optimal performance and comprehensive error handling throughout
the service lifecycle.

    This context manager orchestrates the complete lifecycle of all backend services within
    the Reynard ecosystem, implementing enterprise-grade lifecycle management with priority-based
    startup sequencing, parallel initialization optimization, and comprehensive error handling.

    The lifespan manager provides:
    - Priority-based service initialization with dependency resolution
    - Parallel execution within priority groups for optimal startup performance
    - Comprehensive health monitoring and service status tracking
    - Graceful shutdown procedures with timeout handling and resource cleanup
    - Error handling and recovery mechanisms with detailed logging
    - Service registry integration for centralized lifecycle management

    Initialization Process:
    1. Configuration Loading: Load service configurations and environment settings
    2. Service Registration: Register all services with their priorities and dependencies
    3. Priority-Based Startup: Initialize services in dependency order (highest priority first)
    4. Parallel Execution: Services within same priority group start concurrently
    5. Health Monitoring: Perform health checks and validate service initialization
    6. Router Setup: Configure secure routers and API endpoints
    7. Service Registry: Provide initialized services to the FastAPI application

    Shutdown Process:
    1. Graceful Shutdown: Stop services in reverse priority order
    2. Resource Cleanup: Clean up connections, caches, and temporary resources
    3. Timeout Handling: Ensure shutdown completes within configured timeouts
    4. Error Recovery: Handle shutdown failures gracefully with proper logging

    Args:
        app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance requiring service orchestration.
            The application will receive the initialized service registry and all
            configured services will be available through dependency injection.
