"""Service Shutdown Module for Reynard Backend

This module contains all service shutdown functions for the Reynard backend,
implementing graceful shutdown procedures with proper resource cleanup and
error handling for each service component.

Services:
- Gatekeeper: Authentication service cleanup
- ComfyUI: Image generation service cleanup
- NLWeb: Natural language processing service cleanup

Each shutdown function follows the same pattern:
- Performs graceful resource cleanup
- Handles shutdown errors gracefully
- Provides detailed logging for monitoring
- Does not prevent application shutdown on failure
