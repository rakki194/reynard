"""
Core API Endpoints Module for Reynard Backend

This module contains the core API endpoints for the Reynard backend,
including system information, health checks, and configuration endpoints.

Endpoints:
- Root: System information and API status
- Health: Comprehensive health check for all services
- Detailed Health: In-depth service diagnostics
- Protected: Authentication demonstration endpoint
- Config: Application configuration (development only)

Each endpoint follows FastAPI best practices with proper documentation,
error handling, and response formatting.
