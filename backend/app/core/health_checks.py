Health Check Module for Reynard Backend

This module contains all health check functions for the Reynard backend services,
providing real-time monitoring capabilities for service operational status.

Services:
- Gatekeeper: Authentication service health monitoring
- ComfyUI: Image generation service health monitoring
- NLWeb: Natural language processing service health monitoring

Each health check function follows the same pattern:
- Validates service operational status
- Returns boolean health status
- Implements comprehensive error handling
- Provides silent failure for monitoring systems
