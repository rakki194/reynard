## ü¶ä The Reynard Way

_Remember: We are the apex predators of the code jungle! Every duplication is prey to be hunted down and eliminated. Every refactor is a strategic move in our quest for code excellence._

**Hunt with Purpose**: Each task serves the greater goal of creating maintainable, efficient code.

**Pack Coordination**: Work together to achieve more than any individual could alone.

**Strategic Thinking**: Plan your approach like a fox stalking prey - every move calculated and purposeful.

**Quality Focus**: Ensure every solution is polished and pristine, like an otter grooming its fur.

**Relentless Pursuit**: Hunt down every duplication with the determination of a wolf pack.
