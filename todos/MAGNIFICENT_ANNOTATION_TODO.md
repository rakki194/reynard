## 🦊 **WHY THIS ARCHITECTURE IS MAGNIFICENT**

### **✅ Zero Confusion**

- **No new core packages** - everything builds on what you have
- **Single segmentation package** - clear and focused
- **Existing patterns** - developers already know how to use it
- **Unified interface** - one place for all annotation types

### **🚀 Maximum Leverage**

- **`reynard-ai-shared`** provides service management
- **`reynard-annotating-core`** provides task coordination
- **`reynard-algorithms`** provides polygon operations
- **`reynard-floating-panel`** provides editor layout
- **`reynard-caption`** provides label editing
- **`reynard-boundingbox`** provides coordinate transforms

### **🔗 Seamless Integration**

- **Same backend integration** as existing annotation system
- **Same task management** as caption generation
- **Same UI patterns** as bounding box editing
- **Same performance monitoring** as AI services
