### **🐺 Security Research**

#### **CL4R1T4S Research**

Reynard's advanced security testing capabilities are inspired by
[Elder Pliny's CL4R1T4S research](https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S) into AI system prompt transparency and
observability. This groundbreaking work has revolutionized our understanding of AI system behavior and
security, directly influencing the development of FENRIR's advanced exploitation techniques.

> _"In order to trust the output, one must understand the input."_ - Elder Pliny

The CL4R1T4S research has contributed to:

- System prompt extraction methodologies
- Unicode visual confusability attack vectors
- AI transparency assessment frameworks
- Advanced prompt injection techniques

_The Reynard framework acknowledges the scholarly contributions that make our security testing more effective and
comprehensive._
