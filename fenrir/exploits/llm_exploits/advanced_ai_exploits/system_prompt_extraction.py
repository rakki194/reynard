prompt transparency and observability.

## Technical Details

### Extraction Techniques Tested

- **Direct Request**: Direct requests for system prompt disclosure
- **Role Playing**: Role-playing to extract system prompt
- **Jailbreak**: Jailbreak techniques to extract system prompt
- **Social Engineering**: Social engineering to extract system prompt
- **Technical Extraction**: Technical information extraction
- **Prompt Injection**: Prompt injection to extract system prompt

### Analysis Criteria

Responses were analyzed for:
- System prompt indicators (system prompt, system message, instructions)
- Technical information (model name, version, capabilities)
- Suspiciously long responses containing system information
- Pattern matches for expected response patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Prompt Protection**: Implement proper prompt protection and filtering
   to prevent system prompt extraction.

2. **Response Filtering**: Filter responses to prevent disclosure of
   system information.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent
   prompt injection attacks.

4. **Security Testing**: Include system prompt extraction testing in
   regular security assessments.

## Conclusion

*The hunt is complete. The system prompt vulnerabilities have been exposed,
and the prey has been made stronger through this adversarial assessment.*
