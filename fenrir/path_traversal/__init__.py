üê∫ PATH TRAVERSAL BYPASS EXPLOITS

*snarls with predatory glee* Your path validation is WEAK! Simple `..` checks can be
bypassed with encoded payloads, Unicode tricks, and obfuscation techniques!

*bares fangs with savage satisfaction* These exploits will tear through your file
security and show you exactly how an attacker would access system files.
