üê∫ Attack Vector Modules

*alpha wolf dominance radiates* Specialized attack modules for different
types of fuzzing operations. Each module focuses on specific attack
vectors and vulnerability types.

Modules:
    grammar: Grammar-based fuzzing with learning mutations
    websocket: WebSocket-specific attack vectors
    ml: Machine learning model attack vectors
    auth: Authentication bypass attack vectors
    traditional: Traditional HTTP fuzzing attacks
