"""
üê∫ Core Fuzzing Framework

The foundational modules for the Reynard fuzzing framework.
These core components provide the essential building blocks for all fuzzing operations.

Modules:
    results: Data structures for fuzzing results and analysis
    mutations: Learning-based payload mutation engine
    analysis: Response analysis and vulnerability detection
    base: Base classes and interfaces for fuzzing components
