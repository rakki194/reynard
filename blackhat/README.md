# üê∫ BLACKHAT EXPLOIT TESTING SUITE

*snarls with predatory glee* Welcome to the REAL hunt, pup! This is where I prove that your precious Reynard codebase has vulnerabilities that would make any attacker salivate with anticipation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING

*bares fangs with savage satisfaction* These exploits are designed to ACTUALLY BREAK your system. They will:

- **Crash services** with malformed input
- **Bypass security controls** with encoded payloads  
- **Extract sensitive information** through error messages
- **Execute unauthorized operations** through injection attacks
- **Cause denial of service** through resource exhaustion

## üéØ EXPLOIT CATEGORIES

### 1. **JWT Token Manipulation** (`jwt_exploits/`)

- Secret key generation vulnerability exploitation
- Token replay attacks
- Signature bypass attempts
- Timing attack implementations

### 2. **Path Traversal Bypass** (`path_traversal/`)

- URL-encoded directory traversal
- Unicode path traversal
- Double-encoded payloads
- Windows path separator bypass

### 3. **SQL Injection Bypass** (`sql_injection/`)

- Regex pattern evasion
- Obfuscated payloads
- Blind injection techniques
- Union-based attacks

### 4. **Error Information Disclosure** (`error_disclosure/`)

- Parameter name extraction
- System architecture mapping
- Internal logic discovery
- Stack trace exploitation

### 5. **CORS Misconfiguration** (`cors_exploits/`)

- Wildcard origin abuse
- Credential theft attempts
- Cross-origin request forgery
- Header injection attacks

### 6. **File Upload Attacks** (`file_upload/`)

- DoS through large files
- Malicious file type bypass
- Content-type spoofing
- Chunked upload exploitation

### 7. **Multi-Stage Attack Chains** (`attack_chains/`)

- Coordinated multi-vector attacks
- Privilege escalation sequences
- Data exfiltration pipelines
- Persistence mechanisms

## üöÄ USAGE

*packs hunting formation* To run these exploits:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run specific exploit category
python -m blackhat.jwt_exploits.secret_key_attack

# Run comprehensive attack suite
python -m blackhat.run_all_exploits

# Run with verbose output
python -m blackhat.run_all_exploits --verbose --destructive
```

## üé≠ EXPLOIT PHILOSOPHY

*alpha wolf stance* Each exploit is designed to:

1. **Demonstrate the vulnerability** with working code
2. **Provide proof of concept** that can be weaponized
3. **Show the attack surface** that needs hardening
4. **Enable defensive testing** of your security measures

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER

*howls with purpose* These exploits are for:

- **Educational purposes** only
- **Authorized testing** of your own systems
- **Security research** and improvement
- **Defensive development** and hardening

**DO NOT USE** against systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.

## üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

After running these exploits, you'll understand exactly where your security needs to be hardened. Each exploit includes:

- **Vulnerability explanation** with technical details
- **Attack vector analysis** showing the exploit path
- **Defensive recommendations** for fixing the issue
- **Hardening guidelines** for preventing similar attacks
