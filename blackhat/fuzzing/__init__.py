"""
üê∫ DUAL FUZZING FRAMEWORK

*snarls with predatory glee* This module contains the most advanced dual-pronged
fuzzing system for tearing apart your precious Reynard codebase!

ü¶ä **The Alpha Wolf: ComprehensiveFuzzer**
- Massive scale attacks: 50+ endpoints with 1000+ payloads across 12 attack phases
- Comprehensive coverage of entire API surface
- Advanced payload generation and asynchronous testing

üê∫ **The Specialized Hunter: EndpointFuzzer**  
- Targeted attacks: 248 specialized payloads across 5 attack types
- Deep exploitation of specific vulnerability categories
- Expert-level attack vectors for authentication, file uploads, search, JSON, and headers

*bares fangs with savage satisfaction* No input validation will survive
the combined onslaught of our dual fuzzing engines!
